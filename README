GM-GRID-VIEW (MIT license)
--------------------------

An iOS Grid-View allowing the user to sort the views in the scrollView with a finger: the user can move the items with the finger to sort them and a delegate is notified to ensure the datasource is up-to-date. 
This view is inspired by the UITableView and uses a delegate and a datasource to get the data and interact with it.

Requirements:
- iOS 5 (for NSMutableOrderedSet and to access the UIScrollView gestureRecognizers)
- ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) enabled

Features:
- Works on both the iPhone and iPad
- Works on both portrait and landscape orientation
- Perform a long-touch on a view to be able to move it
- Moving of views works great inside the scrollview
- Only one UIPanGestureRecognizer and one UILongTouchGestureRecognizer used to track ALL views
- Two different animation styles ("Swap" or "Push")
- Demo app provided

ToDo's:
- Not loading all views at once (using CATiledLayer ?)
- Adding a pinch on views to zoom them
- Adding an animation flag on method definition (i.e: animated:(BOOL)animated)
- UnitTests
